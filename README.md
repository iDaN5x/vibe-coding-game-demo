# Kadosh – Tennis Shooter

A simple browser-based 3D third-person shooter. You and up to 3 "Kadosh" enemies fight with tennis rackets and balls. Built with Three.js (WebGL).

**[▶ Play the game](https://iDaN5x.github.io/vibe-coding-game-demo/)**

## Controls

- **WASD** – Move
- **Space** – Jump
- **Ctrl** – Crouch
- **Mouse** – Aim (pointer lock)
- **Left Click** – Shoot (tennis ball)
- **R** – Reload (open new can of balls)

## Mechanics

- **HP:** Shown in the top-left. Enemies hit you with tennis-serve attacks.
- **Magazine:** 3 balls per magazine; reload with R (soda-can style sound).
- **Teabag heal:** Crouch 3 times on a dead enemy corpse to regain 20% HP (max 100%).

## Run locally

Serve the project over HTTP (required for ES modules):

```bash
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 and click **Start Game**. Grant pointer lock when prompted.

Or use any static server, e.g.:

```bash
npx serve . -p 3000
# or
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. Push the repo to GitHub (include `index.html`, `src/`, and `public/`; ensure `public/sounds/` has your generated WAV files if you want audio).
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Choose branch **main** (or your default branch) and folder **/ (root)**. Save.
5. After a minute, the site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`. Share that link with your friend.

The game uses relative paths and ES modules, so it works as-is. The `.nojekyll` file in the repo tells GitHub Pages to serve the files statically without Jekyll. For BGM and death sounds on the hosted site, run `npm run generate-audio` and commit the `public/sounds/` folder (or add it to the repo before pushing).

## Tech

- Three.js (ES modules via import map, no build)
- BGM and "Djokovic" TTS are pre-generated as WAV files; reload SFX is procedural (Web Audio API).
- No external 3D model files; simple geometries only

## Generating audio files

BGM and the "Djokovic" whisper are generated once as WAV files and loaded in the browser.

```bash
npm run generate-audio
```

- **BGM** (`scripts/generate-bgm.js`): Generates `public/sounds/bgm.wav` – 8-bit style square-wave melody (no extra deps).
- **Djokovic** (`scripts/generate-djokovic.js`): Uses the system TTS (**say** on macOS, SAPI on Windows) to say "Djokovic" and writes `public/sounds/djokovic.wav`. Requires `npm install` (adds the `say` package). Export is supported on macOS and Windows only; on Linux you may need to record the file manually or use another TTS.

After generating, run `npm start` and open the game; BGM will loop and "Djokovic" will play when an enemy is killed.

## Assets

- BGM and Djokovic: generated by the scripts above.
- Reload: procedural (soda-can style) in code.
- Taunts are tennis-themed and non-offensive.
